# Assignment Text:
1)You need to change the number of items in the cart on the resource http://demowebshop.tricentis.com/cart . For example, the request sends "2 items", should return "500".
2)Simulate the situation in which the server will return status code 403 when accessing http://demowebshop.tricentis.com/. Requests to other resources should work normally.
3)Sometimes in the work of a tester it is necessary to switch requests from one environment to another. For example, we can't do direct testing on a prod, but need to knock to an environment for testing. Let's assume that http://demowebshop.tricentis.com/ is the prod version and http://demowebshop.tricentis.com/qa is the QA bench. The task is to redirect the request from Prod to QA.
4)It is necessary to remove items from the cart on the resource http://demowebshop.tricentis.com/cart.
5)Simulate the situation when the user will see any picture in the browser when accessing http://demowebshop.tricentis.com/.
